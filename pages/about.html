				G.K. Travels was founded in 1829 by George L. Quiddler, who preferred
				the initials G.K. over his own. Mr. Quiddler had always loved to travel,
				and wanted to make the world accessible to all. </p>
			<p class="p-content">
				At the time, Mr. Quiddler's ideas were revolutionary. Soon people all
				over the world were taking G.K. Travels tours, and Mr. Quiddler enjoyed
				every second of it. To this day, G.K. Travels hopes to channel the spirit
				of Mr. Quiddler in order to promote travel in a way that is accessible to
				everyone. </p>
			<p class="p-content">
				Since 1829, G.K. Travels has run over 200,000 tours in 127 countries.
				We employ experts across the globe to educate our travellers about the
				culture, life, and history of every locale. Join us and
