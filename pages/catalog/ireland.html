				<!--"T" goes here; see styles.css-->he Emerald Isle, as it has long been known,
				has always had a strong sense of identity. How has the culture of an island of
				only 6.5 million people spread around the globe and become a distictive part of
				life worldwide? As many as 80 million people can trace their roots back to Ireland.
				Ireland, perhaps more than anywhere else, is an <em>experience</em> — a place
				separated, in a way, not just from Europe, but from all of reality. From the history
				of the Troubles in Northern Ireland to the cultural isolation of the Irish-speaking
				Gaeltacht, from the famous Cliffs of Moher in the west to the thriving metropolis
				of Dublin in the east, from the volcanic Giant's Causeway in the north to the
				glacial Burren in the west, Ireland, somehow, never changes. Ireland is a pinnacle
				of life in the harsh waves of the Atlantic — despite all odds, it will remain 
				standing forever. </p>
