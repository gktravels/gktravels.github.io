				<!--"B" goes here; see styles.css-->hutan is the last independent Buddhist kingdom anywhere in
				the world. With a population of approximately 750,000 people, Bhutan's serene perch among
				the Himalayas is unrivaled around the globe. Bhutan is unique in other ways, too: despite
				being classified as one of the United Nations' "Least Developed Countries", Bhutan has been
				consistently ranked as one of the happiest countries on Earth; Bhutan transitioned from an
				absolute monarchy to a democracy only in 2008, courtesy of a king who recognized democracy's
				importance despite resistance from the people; within Bhutan lies the tallest unclimbed
				mountain in the world, never summitted because of religious beliefs. Also in Bhutan is one of
				the world's most dangerous airports, with only eight living pilots qualified to land there.
				Bhutan, too, is a place where "Gross National Happiness" is more valuable than GDP; where
				tourism was discouraged to prevent harm it might wreak upon Bhutan's already-fragile culture.
				Where, truly, across the globe, can one find somewhere like Bhutan? The only carbon-negative
				country in the world, and yet one of only four widely-recognized sovereign nations with no
				diplomatic ties to the United States? Bhutan is, and will forever be, extraordinary. </p>
