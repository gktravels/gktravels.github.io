				The novel coronavirus pandemic is new to all of us. Never before has
				G.K. Travels faced such a challenge. But we at G.K. Travels have never
				been ones to flee before a challenge. As part of our mission to help
				educate the public and make travel accessible, we want to make sure
				trips can still happen. </p>

				At the same time, our customers' safety is our first priority. Therefore,
				we have cancelled all previously scheduled trips departing between
				March 12th and October 31st, 2020. All travellers in high-risk
				groups for COVID-19 (including, but not limited to, seniors and those
				with preexisting conditions) will be offerred full refunds, and all
				travellers, regardless of risk level, will be able to reschedule their
				trips at any time in the 12 months following the 31st of October. 
				Customers scheduled to participate in the affected tours will receive
				an email with more detailed information. If you still have questions,
				please <a href="contact.html">contact us directly</a>. </p>
			<p class="p-content">
				G.K. Travels is also working on a high-quality virtual travel portal
				for those travellers who are not able to participate in a trip due to
				COVID-19 symptoms or concerns. We will be sharing more details on this
				program soon. </p>
			<p class="p-content">
				We at G.K. Travels encourage all of our participants to follow appropriate
				guidlines from the 
				<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html"
				   target="_blank">CDC</a> and the 
				<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019"
				   target="_blank">WHO</a>.
				Please be careful, stay safe, and hope that we can all travel again in
				the future! </p>
