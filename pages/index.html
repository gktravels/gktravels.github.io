	--- Notes and Information ---
		-- Directory Guide --
			STYLES: All styles in styles.css stylesheet in /css folder
			PAGES: /pages folder contains all webpages
				-- Directly in /pages are pages contained in navigation bar, including index.html,
					contact.html, about.html, etc.
				-- In /pages/catalog are individual tour pages, such as bhutan.html and ireland.html
			IMAGES: /images folder contains all images, including all formats AND including favicon.ico
				-- /images folder does NOT contain video
			VIDEO/AUDIO: /media includes all video and audio in all formats
			
		-- ID and Class Content Organization for Styling --
			** This is NOT an exhaustive list; please examine styles.css for a complete list of IDs
			   and classes used to style these pages **
			   
			Primarily <div> elements are used to divide the page into three parts:
				-- #header: The title of the page OR the default header with website name
					-> If the header is NOT the default header, class .title is used
					-> .small class is also sometimes used
				-- #content: All page content is within this <div> element. <div> or other elements
					with the following classes can be used:
					-> .subtitle: a smaller heading than the top, often used with <p> or <h2> elements
					-> .p-content: paragraphs of text
						++ some other classes can be used to style these; such as .mono or .story
					-> .box-content: "boxes", or tiles, of text (three per line)
						++ usually links
						++ use classes to define what image to display in box (i.e., .img-bhutan)
					-> .form-content: forms
					-> .img-content: images or figures with captions; sometimes nested in p-content
				-- #footer: Footer of page with copyright information; virtually identical for
					all webpages
		
		-- Extra Research Information --
			Primarily all techniques used in all webpages and stylesheet are addressed in CTY
			Intro to Web Design course. However, some extra research was done to utilize:
				-- favicon.ico file for favicon (modeled on HTML in CTY homepage)
				-- tel: link for phone number
				-- some, limited CSS styles (many of which were in the course textbook but not
					necessarily discussed in the course)
	** Any additional questions can be addressed directly. **
